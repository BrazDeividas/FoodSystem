Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.\nWhisk 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. milk, 2 tsp. food-coloring powder, and half of salt in a small bowl until no lumps remain. Glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; add more milk if needed. For a deeper color, whisk in more powder 1 tsp. at a time until desired color is achieved; adjust with milk if needed. Repeat with second food-coloring powder, remaining salt, remaining 1 cup powdered sugar, and remaining 3 Tbsp. milk, adjusting intensity of color as desired.\nSpoon 1 tsp. first glaze in the center of a small plate. Drizzle 1 tsp. second glaze over the first and use a toothpick to slightly swirl colors together; don\u2019t go overboard. (If you want to decorate larger cookies, add 1 tsp. glaze to plate for each additional inch.)\nGently press the top of a cookie into glaze, then lift up and allow excess glaze to drip back onto the plate. Using a toothpick, pop any air bubbles and swirl colors more if desired. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 2 more cookies, adding \u00BD tsp. of each color of glaze to plate before each cookie is dipped. The glaze will lose its swirly effect at this point. Clean plate and repeat process, decorating cookies in batches of 3 until all cookies have been glazed. Let sit until glaze is set, at least 2 hours.\nDo Ahead: Cookies can be glazed 1 day ahead.

Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and heat, stirring occasionally, until completely smooth. Remove from the heat, whisk in the vanilla, and let cool for about 20 minutes so it\u2019s not piping hot.\nIn a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk together the sugar and eggs for about 5 minutes on medium-high speed, until light and thick and pale yellow. With the mixer on low, slowly add the chocolate-butter mixture and whisk for about 15 seconds. It will not be completely mixed at this point but that\u2019s okay, because you will finish combining all the ingredients by hand.\nChop the remaining 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate into 1-inch chunks and shave the remaining 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate into fine shavings. In a medium bowl, stir together the rye flour, the chopped bittersweet chocolate, shaved unsweetened chocolate, baking powder, salt, and toasted walnuts. Remove the bowl from the mixer, add the rye flour mixture, and fold it in by hand until the dough is completely homogeneous.\nFor best results, scrape the dough into an airtight container and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 to 4 hours or up to overnight before baking.

Spoon 1 tsp. glaze onto exposed semicircle and use a toothpick to help coat evenly; excess will drip over sides. Lift scraper straight up and over chocolate side to create a neat edge. Repeat with remaining cookies and glaze. Let sit until glaze is set, at least 2 hours.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 1 month ahead; freeze. Thaw in refrigerator before using.

Carefully peel away top sheets of parchment from dough and punch out cookies with larger cutters. Punch out centers of half of cookies with smaller cutters. Carefully transfer whole cookies with a spatula to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1\u0022 apart. Sprinkle remaining cut-out cookies with sanding sugar, then transfer to another parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake cookies until edges are set, 7\u201310 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Repeat process with scraps (chill dough again before punching out shapes).\nMelt chocolate and tahini in a bowl in a microwave in 20-second bursts, stirring after each, until chocolate is melted (or melt in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water; do not let bowl touch water). Stir to combine and season with salt. Spread filling over whole cookies; top with cut-out cookies.\nCookies can be assembled 5 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.",

Dollop one-quarter of vanilla dough on top of each chocolate slab and pat into rectangles the same size and shape so that you have 2 layers each.

Wrap logs in plastic wrap and chill until very firm, at least 2 hours.\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00B0F. Working one at a time, unwrap dough and brush with egg. Carefully sprinkle surface with sanding sugar and roll logs in sugar to coat well (really press dough into sugar so it sticks). Slice into rounds a generous 1/4\u0022 thick, rotating after every few cuts to keep slices round. Arrange cookies on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2\u0022 apart.

Working with about one-quarter of dough and chilling remaining dough while you assemble and bake, scoop dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls; you should get 10 per batch.

Roll balls in granulated sugar, then arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 2\u0022 apart.\nBake cookies until centers are cracked and edges are set, 5\u20137 minutes. Resist the urge to bake the cookies longer; the aim is to maintain their chew and they will continue to crisp as they cool. If cookies are puffed, tap pan against counter as soon as they come out of the oven to deflate. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes. Remove cookies from pan and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough for a total of 4 batches and 40 cookies.\nDough can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Unfilled cookies can be made 5 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.\nPlace butter and 6 oz. chocolate in a large bowl. Bring cream just to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, then stir in coffee, vanilla, and salt. Pour hot cream mixture over chocolate and butter and whisk until smooth. Chill until ganache is cooled and thickened, about 20 minutes. Beat with an electric mixer or vigorously by hand with a whisk until lightened in color and stiff.\nMelt remaining 2 oz. chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Transfer to a pastry bag and snip off end of bag (or use a resealable plastic bag and cut off 1 corner) to make a very small opening.\nPlace 1 rounded tablespoon of filling on half of cookies. Press remaining cookies on top. Pipe thin lines of melted chocolate over in desired design.\nFilled cookies can be made 2 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.",
